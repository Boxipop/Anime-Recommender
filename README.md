# Anime Recommender
## [Web Application Link](https://anime-recommender-application.streamlit.app/)
Built a full-stack machine learning web application that uses K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to suggest anime based on user preferences. The model takes in an anime from the user and returns the top 10 most similar anime based off the following features: Demographics (e.g. Shonen), Themes (e.g. Time Travel), Genres (e.g. Action), Synopsis, Studio, and Anime Type (e.g. Series, Movie). 


All anime data was obtained through Jikan, an unofficial and open-source API for MyAnimeList (the world's most active online anime and manga community and database). For a full explanation and walkthrough of the entire process, please refer to the README file.
